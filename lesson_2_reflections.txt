What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git directory is created which contains meta data about commits.
Why? To hold information about each commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is cache type (change is temperary) where working directory and repository change is permanent.
It offer flexbility and cross checking of files just before doing any commit.
