How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By showing just the difference in two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By keeping track of changes and modifications.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    inconsistency in logical points.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To maintain consistency in code.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log : show all commit points
    git log --stat: show all commit points with magnitude of changes
    git diff ver1 ver2: show all difference between two versions compared

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	you have previous commits where you can revert which is fully working.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    real time application
